PGA REACH, the 501(c)(3) charitable foundation of the PGA of America, whose mission is to impact lives through golf, has been named an Official Charity Partner of the 2017 TCS New York City Marathon.  More than 350 official charity partners will be part of the 2017 TCS New York City Marathon, which offers a unique and wide-reaching platform to raise awareness for important causes, such as PGA REACH.  

The race will take place on Sunday, November 5, 2017.  Last year, 9,000 charity runners raised $36.1 million during the marathon on behalf of hundreds of not-for-profit organizations across the nation.  Since the inception of the Official Charity Partner program in 2006, a total of $235 million has been raised.

"PGA REACH is proud to serve as an Official Charity Partner of the 2017 TCS New York City Marathon," said PGA of America CEO Pete Bevacqua, who will run as part of the PGA REACH team in the marathon.  "The PGA REACH team is excited to have a unique opportunity to run in this remarkable event, in order to raise money and awareness for the mission of PGA REACH."

In addition to Bevacqua, the PGA REACH team runners include: PGA Board Members Kyle Heyen, Scott Ashworth and Tim Fries; Kentucky PGA Section President and PGA Master Professional Ralph Landrum; Sun Country PGA Secretary Matthew Long; and GOLFTEC CEO and PGA Member Joe Assell.  The PGA of America runners are charged with a goal of individually raising a minimum of $2,500 each in support of PGA REACH.

The 2017 TCS New York City Marathon will feature a world-class American and international professional athlete field, charity runners, and thousands of runners of all ages and abilities.  More than 10,000 volunteers help to support participants across the 26.2-mile race route, which touches each of New York City's five boroughs and is lined with more than 1 million neighbors and guests.  The 2017 TCS New York City Marathon will be broadcast live nationally on ESPN2.

"We are thrilled to welcome PGA REACH as an Official Charity Partner of the 2017 TCS New York City Marathon," said Michael Rodgers, Vice President of Development and Philanthropy for New York Road Runners. "Participants in our Official Charity Partner program run for causes that are important to them, while raising critical funds that directly impact hundreds of charity organizations.  We are inspired by the thousands of runners who take part in this program, and wish them all the best, as they begin their incredible journey to the 2017 TCS New York City Marathon."
