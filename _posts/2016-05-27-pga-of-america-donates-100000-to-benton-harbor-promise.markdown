Today, at the [77th Senior PGA Championship presented by KitchenAid][1], the [PGA of America][2], through its charitable foundation PGA REACH, announced a donation of $100,000 to Benton Harbor Promise, a scholarship program that provides free two-year tuition to a community college or career technical program in Michigan for qualifying Benton Harbor students. The donation was made possible from funds raised through the National Car Rental/Michigan PGA Section Pro-Am and the Senior PGA Championship Pro-Am, both of which were played earlier this week at Point O' Woods Country Club and Harbor Shores, respectively.

The $100,000 donation was presented to Benton Harbor Promise Chairwomen, Cathy Averill and Dr. Lynn Todman during the Host Community Breakfast, featuring government representatives from the state, at Harbor Shores in Benton Harbor, Michigan.

"We are thrilled and so thankful for the continued support that we receive from PGA REACH each year and its dedication to improving the lives of our young community members," said Dr. Todman, chairman of Benton Harbor Promise. "This generous donation will help pave the path for future generations in Benton Harbor and continue to inspire young people in our area for years to come."

Benton Harbor Promise launched its scholarship program in 2011, two years after legislation was signed by then Governor Jennifer Granholm awarding ten Promise Zone designations in communities across Michigan, including Benton Harbor. This year's graduating class is the sixth class of scholarship eligible students for Benton Harbor Promise.

"Together, with National Car Rental, we are thrilled to invest in the Benton Harbor community, building opportunities and enriching the lives of future generations and residents of this area," said Scott Kmiec, senior director of PGA REACH. "This donation to Benton Harbor Promise will help provide opportunities for the students of this community for years to come. We look forward to watching the positive impact unfold."

The Senior PGA Championship presented by KitchenAid, the most historic and prestigious senior major, features the strongest field in senior golf. Players in this year's field include 2014 and 2015 Champion Colin Montgomerie, 2012 Champion Roger Chapman and John Daly.
