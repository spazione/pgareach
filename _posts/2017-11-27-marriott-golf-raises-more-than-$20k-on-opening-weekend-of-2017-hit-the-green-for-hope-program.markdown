ORLANDO, Fla. (June 22, 2017) â€“ Marriott Golf, one of the world's premier golf operators, in collaboration with PGA REACH, the charitable foundation of the PGA of America, today announced that the opening weekend of the 2017**_ Hit the Green for HOPE_ **campaign generated more than $20,000, with 100% of the proceeds supporting** _PGA HOPE_ (Helping Our Patriots Everywhere)**, golf programming for United States military Veterans with disabilities.

** **

Approximately 2,000 golfers at 17 participating Marriott Golf properties nationwide participated in the promotion's opening weekend, as players won an assortment of prizes/golf shop discounts by hitting the green on a designated par 3 at each respective facility, all while supporting military heroes. The 2017 **_Hit the Green for HOPE_ **campaign will also take place at various locations on Independence Day, Labor Day, and Veterans Day, while several properties will offer unique variations of this philanthropic initiative throughout the year.

 

**PGA HOPE **is the flagship military program of PGA REACH, the 501 (c)3 charitable foundation of the PGA of America. The HOPE program introduces golf to Veterans with disabilities to enhance their physical, mental, social, and emotional well-being. Led by PGA Professionals, **PGA HOPE** has helped thousands of Veterans assimilate back into their communities through the social interaction the game of golf provides. All **PGA HOPE **programming is fully funded by PGA REACH and offered at **_NO COST _**for military Veterans.

 

Participants of **PGA HOPE **programs include military Veterans living with physical or cognitive challenges such as Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), and amputations, among other challenges. 

 

 "What a fantastic opening weekend for the PGA Hope program with more than $20K raised" said Bill Nault, Vice President, Marriott Golf. "With this initial success I'm looking forward to more events throughout the year, so Marriott can continue to have a positive impact on the rehabilitation process for so many Veterans across the country."
