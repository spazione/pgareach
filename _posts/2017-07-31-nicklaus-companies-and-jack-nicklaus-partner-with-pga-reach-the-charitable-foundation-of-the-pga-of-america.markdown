_Nicklaus Companies Named a Trustee and Official Partner of PGA REACH and the PGA of America_ 

PALM BEACH GARDENS, Fla. (July 31, 2017) — PGA REACH, the 501 (c)(3) charitable foundation of the PGA of America, and the Nicklaus Companies announced today a historic partnership to support PGA REACH in its mission of impacting lives by enabling access to PGA Members, PGA Sections, and the game of golf.

The partnership includes financial support from the Nicklaus Companies, as well as a personal commitment from its founder, Jack Nicklaus, to make an impact on all three areas of focus for PGA REACH: Youth, Military, and Diversity & Inclusion. The Nicklaus Companies will become a PGA REACH Trustee, and Jack Nicklaus will serve as a spokesperson for PGA REACH. He will also help promote PGA Junior League Golf, which is a fun, social and inclusive opportunity for boys and girls to learn and enjoy the game of golf in a team environment under the direction of PGA and LPGA Professionals.

"I have a long history with the PGA of America, and I have always had great respect and appreciation for what they do as an organization and through their membership," said Jack Nicklaus, who last year celebrated 50 years of membership in the organization. Nicklaus tied Walter Hagen's record of five PGA Championship victories in 1980 with his win at Oak Hill Country Club, while his wife, Barbara, received the inaugural PGA First Lady of Golf award in 1998.

"From my earliest days learning the game from PGA Professional Jack Grout, to the years helping raise money for junior golf programs, I have been passionate about the role of PGA Professionals as the day-to-day caretakers of the game and those who help grow the game at the green-grass level. We are here to make an impact, and I hope our role can draw others in the game to join us."

In addition, the Nicklaus Companies will become an Official Partner of PGA REACH and the PGA of America. A portion of the proceeds from the sale of Nicklaus Companies products to PGA Member facilities will benefit PGA REACH.

"I believe that there is no person who embodies the values and traditions of the game better than Jack Nicklaus," said Nicklaus Companies Chairman Howard Milstein. "We are dedicated as a company to giving back and growing the game with the PGA, and we are proud to partner with PGA REACH as a Trustee, building the game's future."

"We're honored that Jack Nicklaus, Howard Milstein and the Nicklaus Companies have teamed with both PGA REACH and the PGA of America to deliver a positive impact on the lives of today's youth, our military veterans, and people of diversity through the game of golf," said PGA of America CEO Pete Bevacqua. "Their commitment to help grow the game is so important to our mission."

Additional highlights of the partnership include:

-The creation of a $100,000 Jack Nicklaus PGA HOPE (Helping Our Patriots Everywhere) Grant will launch five new PGA HOPE programs. PGA HOPE introduces golf to military veterans in order to enhance their physical, mental, social and emotional well-being.

-A commitment by PGA REACH and Jack Nicklaus to explore the construction of a PGA HOPE Jack Nicklaus golf facility as a means to help in the care and rehabilitation of veterans.

-The creation of a $120,000 Nicklaus PGA WORKS grant that will enable the addition of two PGA WORKS interns for two years in both the Northern and Southern Ohio PGA Sections. PGA WORKS provides internship opportunities for individuals from diverse backgrounds to gain experience in all facets of the golf industry.

-The Memorial Tournament presented by Nationwide, which was founded by Jack Nicklaus and is annually hosted by the Golden Bear and his family, will also support PGA REACH and its programs.

-The PGA will explore the potential integration of Jack Nicklaus Learning Leagues (JNLL) as one of its golf outreach programs, targeting various communities around the country and part of its Leagues programs. The JNLL was launched by Nicklaus with a goal to create programs at National Recreation and Park Association facilities that introduce the game to young players in a safe, fun and team-oriented environment.
