**PALM BEACH GARDENS, Fla.** PGA REACH, the 501 (c)(3) charitable foundation of the PGA of America—in conjunction with the Middle Atlantic PGA Section Foundation—has selected Tajma Brown, a 2016 Hampton University graduate, for the PGA WORKS Internship program. PGA WORKS aspires to be the most valuable internship opportunity for individuals from diverse backgrounds to garner experience in all facets of the golf industry.

The PGA of America recognizes that it will be defined by how its commitment to diversity and inclusion resonates throughout its programs and practices. This commitment is vital to the health and relevance of the Association's business and the game overall.

"All career paths start with awareness and opportunity, and providing individuals from diverse backgrounds entry into the golf industry is a priority for PGA REACH," said Ryan Cannon, Senior Director, PGA REACH. "PGA WORKS is an important initiative, and we're thrilled to have Tajma begin her career in golf with the Middle Atlantic PGA Foundation."

Brown earned her Masters Degree in Sports Management from West Virginia University. She will support programming of the Middle Atlantic PGA Foundation, which serves as the philanthropic entity of the Section.

A resident of Wilmington, Delaware, Brown's experience includes serving as an intern for the NBA's Philadelphia 76ers and Minor League Baseball's Wilmington Blue Rocks. She worked in several capacities for Hampton University's Department of Athletics and founded the school's Sport Management Club.

"In five years, I see myself working with a task force at the PGA to help bring more women and other minority groups into the game," said Brown. "I believe that to tackle the issue of diversity and inclusion in golf, it must start with the marketing and promotion of programs that already exist, specifically speaking on programs for youth."
