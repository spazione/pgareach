## Acclaimed club to offer rehabilitative golf programming to Military Veterans with Disabilities; program funded by PGA REACH …

PALM BEACH GARDENS, Fla. – PGA REACH, the 501(c)(3) charitable foundation of the PGA of America, announced today that Congressional Country Club in Bethesda, Maryland, will host a PGA HOPE program in 2017.

PGA HOPE (Helping Our Patriots Everywhere)—the flagship Military Program of PGA REACH—introduces golf to Veterans in order to enhance their physical, mental, social and emotional well-being. All PGA HOPE programming is fully funded by PGA REACH and offered at NO COST to Military Veterans.

Led by PGA Professionals, PGA HOPE has helped thousands of Veterans assimilate back into their communities through the social interaction the game of golf provides.

The new HOPE Chapter at Congressional Country Club was announced by PGA President Paul Levy, along with PGA HOPE Coordinator Chris Nowak, Congressional Country Club President Rick Sullivan, Congressional Chief Executive Jeffrey Kreafle and the club's PGA Director of Athletics Jason Epstein—who will lead the new Washington, D.C.-area PGA HOPE program, which is scheduled to begin this fall.

"We commend the leadership and PGA Members at Congressional Country Club for deciding to conduct a PGA HOPE program to help our nation's heroes," said Levy. "Providing an opportunity for Veterans to get active again, through the wonderful game of golf, continues to have a positive impact on their rehabilitation process."

Golf has been a part of the therapeutic rehabilitation process for more than 3,500 Veterans through PGA HOPE. Participants of PGA HOPE programs include military Veterans who live with physical or cognitive challenges, such as Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and amputations, among other challenges. The PGA HOPE Program at Congressional Country Club will be the third program in the Middle Atlantic PGA Section.
