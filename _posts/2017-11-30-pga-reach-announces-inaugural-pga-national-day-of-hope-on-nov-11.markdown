_PGA HOPE (Helping Our Patriots Everywhere) Golf Programs Continue to __Expand Nationwide; Inspiring 'Hero' Video Featuring Jack Nicklaus Highlights Impact of PGA HOPE on Military Veterans._

PALM BEACH GARDENS, Fla. (Nov. 9, 2017) PGA REACH, the 501(c)(3) charitable foundation of the PGA of America, has announced that Saturday, Nov. 11—Veterans Day— will serve as the inaugural **PGA National Day of HOPE.  **

**PGA National Day of HOPE **has two goals: Celebrate our nation's heroes who protect our freedom; and raise awareness and support for the PGA HOPE (Helping Our Patriots Everywhere) program, so that it can continue to grow.

To support **PGA National Day of HOPE**, [an inspirational "Hero" video featuring Jack Nicklaus][1] that highlights the positive impact of PGA HOPE programming will be released in advance of Veteran's Day. Additionally, Chris Nowak, PGA HOPE Military and Veteran Liaison, will share his inspirational story during a segment on Golf Channel's Morning Drive on Nov. 11. As a U.S. Marine corporal, Nowak was medically retired after losing his leg from a friendly fire accident during training. 

PGA HOPE introduces golf to veterans with disabilities to enhance their physical, mental, social and emotional well-being. The program features a six-to-eight week instructional golf clinic, followed by a graduation ceremony and on-course golfing opportunities. Fully funded by PGA REACH, PGA HOPE is offered at NO COST to military veterans. Led by PGA Professionals, PGA HOPE has helped thousands of veterans assimilate back into their communities through the social interaction the game of golf provides.

"Golf can be an extremely effective part of the therapeutic rehabilitation process, and PGA HOPE is making a difference in the lives of thousands of veterans," said Ryan Cannon, Senior Director, PGA REACH. "PGA HOPE programming takes place year-round, but on Veterans Day, we invite the entire golf community to join us in honoring our country's heroes, and raising awareness for PGA HOPE, so that it can continue to expand and serve even more veterans."

Prior to 2017, there were 68 HOPE chapters impacting 3,500 veterans to date. The goal for 2017 is to serve 80 locations and an additional 1,200 veterans across the United States.
