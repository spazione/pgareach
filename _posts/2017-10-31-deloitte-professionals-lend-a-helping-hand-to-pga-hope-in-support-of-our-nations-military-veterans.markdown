A dozen Deloitte professionals volunteered their time at the Fall PGA HOPE Met Section Graduation event at the Woodside Club in Syosset, New York, on Oct.18.

PGA HOPE introduces golf to veterans with disabilities to enhance their physical, mental, social and emotional well-being. The program features a six-to-eight week instructional golf clinic, followed by a graduation ceremony and on-course golfing opportunities.

Deloitte professionals were on-hand to help ensure that the graduation experience was a memorable one for the Veterans. From registering to scoring, directing the Veterans to their golf carts, and helping them find golf balls on the course — Deloitte's volunteer efforts made an impact.

"Golf can be an extremely effective part of the therapeutic rehabilitation process, and PGA HOPE is making a difference in the lives of thousands of veterans," said Ryan Cannon, Senior Director, PGA REACH. "We are grateful for the support Deloitte Consulting LLP provides to the PGA HOPE program."

Fully funded by PGA REACH, PGA HOPE is offered at NO COST to military veterans. Led by PGA Professionals, PGA HOPE has helped thousands of veterans assimilate back into their communities through the social interaction the game of golf provides. Deloitte Consulting LLP provides consulting advice and funding to PGA REACH, in order to help scale PGA HOPE to greater heights. 

"I cannot thank you enough for the opportunity to volunteer," said Pat Conrad, a Deloitte Consulting LLP human capital consultant and military Veteran. "This was my first experience with PGA HOPE. I was extremely impressed with how professional the event was, and most importantly, the level of impact it had on participating veterans. As a former U.S. Marine and avid golfer, I would love to continue to volunteer to help PGA HOPE through Deloitte." 

Prior to 2017, there were 68 HOPE chapters impacting 3,500 veterans. The goal for 2017 is to serve 80 locations and an additional 1,200 veterans across the United States.
