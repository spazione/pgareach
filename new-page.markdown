          PGA Junior League Golf is a fun, social and inclusive opportunity for boys and girls, ages 13 and under, to learn and enjoy the game of golf from PGA & LPGA Professionals.

          In 2016, there were a record-setting 36,000 PGA JLG participants; a 300% increase over the past three years

          2017 PGA REACH will begin to provide financial assistance to thousands of kids through The First Tee and Boys and Girls Clubs of America so they can participate in JLG
