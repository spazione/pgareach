<p>Marriott Golf, one of the world’s premier golf operators, has teamed up with PGA REACH – the charitable foundation of the PGA of America – to launch <strong><em>Hit the Green for HOPE</em></strong>, a Memorial Day Weekend campaign in support of <strong><em>PGA HOPE</em></strong> – golf programming for United States military Veterans with disabilities.</p>
<p>Golfers will have the opportunity to take part in the <strong><em>Hit the Green for HOPE</em></strong> promotion at 17 participating Marriott Golf properties nationwide. By donating $10, on a designated par-3 hole at each property, any golfer that hits the green on his/her tee shot receives a certificate valid for 30% off “their next purchase” in the golf shop. All participating golfers who do not hit the green will receive a certificate valid for 15% off “their next purchase” in the golf shop. The certificates are valid for merchandise only, and all certificates are valid through Dec. 31, 2016, at the golf shop of the participating property.  100% of proceeds from the campaign will be used to support and enhance **PGA HOPE **programming.</p>
<p><strong>PGA HOPE **<em>(Helping Our Patriots Everywhere)</em> is the flagship Military program of PGA REACH – the charitable foundation of the PGA of America. The HOPE program introduces golf to Veterans with disabilities in order to enhance their physical, mental, social and emotional well-being. Led by PGA Professionals, **PGA HOPE</strong> is a proven activity that has helped thousands of Veterans assimilate back into their communities through the social interaction the game of golf provides. All <strong>PGA HOPE **programming is fully funded by PGA REACH and offered at **_NO COST _</strong>for military Veterans.</p>
<p>“Military Veterans have made tremendous sacrifices to protect our freedom, and it’s important that we all do our part, as many struggle with the transition back to civilian life,” said Bill Nault, Vice President, Marriott Golf. “<strong><em>PGA HOPE</em></strong> is a fantastic program that inspires wounded Veterans to learn and play golf as a therapeutic form of their rehabilitation, and it’s rewarding to see Marriott Golf take such an active role in supporting a program that is truly making a difference for thousands of Veterans.”</p>
<p>Participants of <strong>HOPE **programs include military Veterans living with physical or cognitive challenges such as Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and amputees, among other challenges.  As golf has become a therapeutic part of the rehabilitation process for many Veterans with disabilities, it is only fitting that Veterans who have participated in **HOPE</strong> programming will be on-site at several participating locations during the Memorial Day Weekend promotional period.</p>
<p>“We are very excited to align PGA REACH and our flagship military program <strong>PGA HOPE</strong> with Marriott Golf and its portfolio of resort and championship golf venues,” said Scott Kmiec, Senior Director of PGA REACH. “Through programming like <strong>PGA HOPE</strong>, and thanks to the corporate responsibility of organizations like Marriott Golf, the PGA of America will be in a position to make a more meaningful impact on the lives of America’s military Veterans.”</p>
