        ## **Saturday, November 11 – Veterans Day – served as the inaugural PGA National Day of HOPE. The Hero video above, featuring Jack Nicklaus, highlights the positive impact that PGA HOPE has on the lives of our Military Veterans.**

        ## **Prior to 2017,** there were 68 HOPE chapters impacting 3,500 veterans to date

        ## **2017 Goal:** 80 locations serving an additional 1,200 veterans across the U.S.

                    It is a fact that suicide is a major issue among military Veterans, with recent statistical studies showing that 22 Veterans a day commit suicide. PGA HOPE is working to change this statistic.

                    Participants of **PGA** HOPE programs include military Veterans living with physical or cognitive challenges such as Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and amputees, among other challenges.

                    The Department of Veterans Affairs research and clinical experience verify that physical activity is important to maintaining good health, speeding recovery and improving overall quality of life. For many injured Veterans, adaptive sports provide their first exposure to physical activity after injury.

                    PGA HOPE programming is fully funded by PGA REACH and offered at NO COST for Military Veterans.

                    PGA HOPE has a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Department of Veterans Affairs, which enables Recreational Therapists to refer Veterans to the PGA HOPE program as a form of therapy.
